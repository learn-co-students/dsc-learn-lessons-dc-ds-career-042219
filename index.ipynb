For those lessons, you don't need to know *any* of what we're teaching below. All you need to do is to read them on Learn. Enjoy!\n", "\n", "However, there are some lessons that require you to write code - **Projects** and **Labs**. Generally, labs are a little shorter, allowing you to practice a specific skill in isolation (like practicing throwing the ball up without hitting it to improve your tennis serve). Projects come towards the end of a section and are more open-ended, allowing you to bring together a range of different skills that you have learned (like playing a whole game of tennis - or at least practicing a complete serve).\n", "\n", "It's easy to tell from a lesson's title if it is a Project, a Lab, or a README. If the title ends with \"Lab\", it's a lab. If the title starts with the word \"Project\", it's a project. If the title doesn't end with either a \"Lab\" or a \"Project\", it's a README!\n", "\n", "**The process we're teaching you below is only required for labs and projects - not READMEs**\n", "\n", "## The Command Line\n", "\n", "Before we get to Jupyter Notebooks, we'll need to know a tiny bit about command line. On Mac computers, this is the terminal application. On Windows computers, we'll use \"Git Bash\". The command line serves as a low-level interpreter through which you, the user, can send commands directly to the computer. As a computer user, you previously have probably sent commands to the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as a web browser, text editor, photo editor, or any other of the myriad of computer programs now in existence. While the command line is initially daunting with its cryptic looking text, we will quickly see some of the many advantages it can have.\n", "\n", "One of the many useful features of the command line will be using *git* to clone (download) a local copy of the curriculum hosted on learn.co. This will allow you to work offline and to save changes as you work through exercises and start programming! \n", "\n", "To start, **for Mac users, open the terminal application**, **for Windows, open \u201cGit Bash\u201d**.\n", "\n", "### pwd\n", "\n", "The first command to try out is **pwd** which stands for **print working directory**. This will tell you where you currently are in the computer's directory structure. Try it out.\n", "\n", "### cd\n", "\n", "The next essential command is **cd** which stands for **change directory**. This allows you to navigate to different folders on your computer's hard drive. Typing cd by itself will automatically take you to your home directory. Typing cd and a folder name will take you to that folder. Typing cd .. will move you one folder up in the hierarchy. Play around and trying moving between folders for a minute or two.\n", "\n", "### Tab Completion\n", "\n", "An extraordinarly useful feature when working with the command line is tab completion. This allows you to hit the tab button to autocomplete names once you have made a unique specification.  \n", "\n", "\n", "For example, if you navigate to your root directory by running the command **cd**, if you're on a Mac, you will probably have 2 folders within your root directory named \"Downloads\" and \"Documents\" (these are standard folder names created by default in most systems, although you may have renamed them, or your system may be different). With these, or longer folder names, it can sometimes become cumbersome to type the full folder name. instead, you can start typing the command and folder name such as **\"cd Dow\"** and then press **tab** to autocomplete. Like magic, the command line should complete the statement correctly to be **cd Downloads**. (Note: this will not work if you have another folder that begins with \"Dow\". Similarly, if you just typed **cd D** or **cd Do** followed by **tab**, the command line will not autocomplete, as the selection is not unique, because **D** or **Do** could both refer to either **Documents** or **Downloads**. Also note that these commands are case sensitive, and folder capitalization much be matched exactly.\n", "\n", "### ls\n", "\n", "Continuing with navigating the computer's hard drive, it's useful to know how to **list files**. This is done with the **ls** command, short for list.\n", "\n", "You can also pass optional parameters to ls such as **ls -a** which lists **all files** (including hidden files), **ls -l** gives a **long listing** of files (including file size and last edit times). You can also pass multiple parameters simultaneously such as **ls -al** to produce a detailed listing of all files.\n", "\n", "### * the wildcard parameter\n", "\n", "Also very useful is the wildcard parameter. For example, if you wanted to list all files in the current working directory that begin with a, you could type **`ls a*`**. Here, the asterix (`*`) denotes anything is allowed following the a. Similarly, to list all pdf files in the current working directory you can use **`ls *.pdf`**, or to list all text files, you can use **`ls *.txt`**.\n", "\n", "### mkdir\n", "\n", "Finally, as you continue to navigate the file directory from the command line it can be useful to be able to create new folders. To do this, use the **mkdir** command, which stands for **make directory**. Try it out with **mkdir NewFolderName**. Afterward, use the **ls** command to see that there is indeed a new folder, and if you wish, move into the new folder using the **cd** command.\n", "\n", "## Cloning GitHub repositories and Learn.co lessons\n", "\n", "You have already read a little bit about GitHub and how it's used to share code. Since you can now navigate the file directory using the command line, you're ready to download some course materials from GitHub to your local environment. In practice, you will do the following:\n", "\n", "* **Fork** the course material repository: Forking is the process of making a personal copy of the Learn course materials on your own GitHub account.\n", "\n", "* **Clone** the forked course material repository: Cloning is the process of downloading a repository from Github onto your personal computer. \n", "\n", "Don't worry if this process seems a little confusing. It will be explained in more detail soon.
